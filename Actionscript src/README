Red Rogue is a platformer-roguelike written in Flex and compiled with FlashDevelop.

The game is played with arrow keys (or w,a,s,d) and the space bar.

There is no jump. Landing on an opponent causes knockback/stun.

The space bar opens a menu, from there the inventory can be accessed to equip you and your minion, to cast spells, search for traps and other things.

There's also default hot-key-bindings, go to the website and click on "instructions" to discover what they are.

If you were more interested in the old revision of the code, you can work with the branch "old".
